The article examines machine learning systems developed for user behavior analysis and forecasting, focusing on methods that adeptly simulate complicated user interaction patterns through various algorithms. Hyperspectral imaging offers considerable potential in remote sensing applications, especially for land cover and land-use classification, due to its capacity to acquire extensive spectral data. Nonetheless, utilizing hyperspectral data for precise segmentation has significant problems, such as the curse of dimensionality and the limited availability of ground truth data, which impede the accuracy and efficiency of machine learning methodologies. The findings indicate a steady enhancement in predictive performance and a decrease in inference time due to the incorporation of feature engineering techniques. Significantly, although feature modification and feature selection markedly improved performance, feature extraction had a comparatively negligible effect. This highlights the effectiveness of the suggested feature transformation-selection method for dimensionality reduction and performance enhancement."

Because India is home to a plethora of traditional knowledge and heritage buildings that have been constructed over ages to suit local climates and lifestyles, this invention specifically focused on India is pertinent. The AI-driven design frequently puts efficiency and contemporary aesthetics first, which may ignore or misunderstand the cultural components. Instead of only using conventional solutions, it is crucial to investigate how AI may incorporate or respect vernacular design principles and cultural legacy in the Indian setting by investigating its integration at the early stages of the architectural design process. The aim of this invention is to look into how AI training models can be used in architectural design processes to create and refine spatial designs that meet Indian cultural norms. The Kath Kuni vernacular architecture of the upper hills of Himachal Pradesh has been selected as the pilot. In order to accomplish this goal, the research approach is organized into several phases. A thorough investigation of various AI modalities and their potential to produce architectural spaces that incorporate cultural components is the first step. This involves evaluating training models for picture production and how well they iterate ideas based on vernacular principles. In parallel, the invention/research looks at; (i) how AI is incorporated into architectural workflows, highlighting current patterns, difficulties, and chances to try out novel approaches? (ii) to comprehend how cultural components are organically incorporated into design methods, traditional architectural techniques are examined in addition to AI-focused studies? This includes analysing image-generation training models and their effectiveness in iterating designs based on vernacular principles. Simultaneously, the invention/research study examines existing AI integration in architectural workflows, identifying current trends, challenges, and opportunities for experimentation with new methodologies.

Sentiment analysis is a promising research domain that lends itself to analyzing the people?s opinion regarding various topical issues. Aspect-based sentiment analysis is a fine-grained approach to analyze the sentiments expressed at the aspect level rather than a coarse-grained analysis of sentiments associated with the entire review or review sentences. While on most of the occasions the aspects are explicitly specified by the users, in some situations they are hidden(implicit) in the review text which is very challenging to detect. In this context, one of the innovative ideas proposed in this patent is the design of a set of algorithms using computational thinking to carry out explicit aspect extraction and implicit aspect detection. Detecting implicit aspects is very crucial to improve the efficiency of the overall aspect extraction task. By detecting maximum number of explicit and implicit aspects, it is possible to carry out sentiment orientation detection for all identified aspects that contributes to a reasonable improvement in the accuracy of the aspect-based sentiment analysis task. Yet another innovative idea of this proposal is the design of an ennead scale for measuring the sentiment strength of the opinion expressed about the detected aspects. The proposed ennead scale is designed based on the degree of intensification associated with the intensifiers that usually collocate with the opinion words. These innovative ideas proposed for patent are very promising and indispensible for an efficient implementation of aspect ? based sentiment analysis."

Safety issues for women and children arise from the rise in child sexual abuse and harassment in the modern society. The physical and sexual abuse against innocent and vulnerable children keeps increasing. When not educated about the differences between good touch and bad touch, children do not even understand that what is happening to them is wrong. They are unsure about the physical boundaries that they must maintain while interacting with different people. While there may be different cultural norms and customs around hospitality and socialization, the fundamental distinction between good and bad touch is universal. Many such incidents go unnoticed due to the stigma associated with societal judgment. In such cases, knowing the signs of sexual abuse can help give voice to children to fight against the perpetrator and call out their act. The toy thus finds its profound value in educating children about the good and bad touch, promoting cultural ethos, promoting awareness, breaking barriers for children to learn, and educating sexual awareness. The toy detects whether the touch is good or bad by emitting a sound (""SAFE TOUCH"" or ""UN-SAFE TOUCH"").

Smart automation can reduce costs while still satisfying energy demand. The residential, commercial, and industrial sectors can utilize the technologies of the Internet of Things (IoT) to manage energy consumption better. This paper presents a low-cost, open-source, and reliable Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system for home monitoring and control system. The presented SCADA system consists of analog sensors, ESP32, Node-RED, and Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) through local Wi-Fi to remotely access and control appliances. This system helps the users to monitor various conditions in the home, such as temperature, humidity, pressure, and light intensity. Thus, users can remotely monitor various devices such as lights, fans, heating/cooling systems, make decisions based on the feedback of sensors. One of the most important goals in today's complex environment is to determine the emotions of others by observing their faces. In the near future, all electronic devices will be controlled by a virtual assistant. This will require increased security measures, but will be easy to access. This project will apply facial recognition technologies to safeguard the virtual assistant. The architecture guarantees that only authorised users can issue voice instructions. Consequently, we can safeguard the AI from danger. You can request about the current time, date, and weather, among other things, in a customer service email. This virtual assistant can be used to send emails by just giving it instructions. Also, it may record our chats and keep them confidential. The user who has not yet been authorised to use the service can register for it, but the system administrator must first allow them permission to do so. It can exchange photos and documents in response to spoken directions. We can instruct it to use the camera by providing instructions. Several members of the same household can utilise the digital assistant thanks to facial recognition."

It is critical to develop the next generation?s AI competencies and educate them about how to work with and use AI. Previous studies on AI were predominantly focused on secondary and university education; however, research on the Artificial Intelligence curriculum in early childhood education is scarce. Due to the lack of conformity on the standardisation of AI curriculum for early childhood education, this study examines the AI curriculum for kindergarten children using the framework which consists of four key components, including (1) aims, goals, objectives, or declarations of outcome, (2) subject matter, domains, or content, (3) methods or procedure, (4) evaluation and assessment. We recommend that AI literacy be achieved by three competencies: AI Knowledge, AI Skill, and AI Attitude. The employment of a social robot as a learning companion and programmable artifact was proven to be helpful in assisting young children in grasping AI principles. We also discovered which teaching methods had the most greatest influence on students? learning. We recommend problem-based learning for future AI education based on the findings."
